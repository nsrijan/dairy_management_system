# Tenant Administration System

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the tenant administration system, including roles, responsibilities, and system architecture.

## System Architecture

### Entity Relationships
```
Tenant
  ├── Companies
  │    ├── Users
  │    └── Roles (Company-specific)
  ├── Users (Tenant-wide)
  └── Roles (Tenant-wide)
```

### Role Hierarchy
1. **System-defined Base Roles**
   - TENANT_ADMIN
     - Full access to tenant resources
     - Can manage companies
     - Can manage users and roles
   - COMPANY_ADMIN
     - Full access to company resources
     - Can manage company users
     - Can assign company roles
   - COMPANY_USER
     - Basic access to company resources
     - Role can be enhanced with additional permissions

2. **Custom Roles**
   - Created by Tenant Admin
   - Inherits from base roles
   - Configurable permissions
   - Scope limited to specific company

### Permissions System
1. **Tenant-level Permissions**
   - MANAGE_COMPANIES
   - MANAGE_USERS
   - VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS
   - MANAGE_TENANT_SETTINGS
   - VIEW_ANALYTICS

2. **Company-level Permissions**
   - MANAGE_COMPANY_USERS
   - MANAGE_COMPANY_ROLES
   - VIEW_COMPANY_ANALYTICS
   - MANAGE_COMPANY_SETTINGS

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Tenant Admin Features
- [ ] Tenant Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Company Management CRUD
- [ ] Basic User Management
- [ ] Activity Logging

### Phase 2: Role Management
- [ ] Role Creation Interface
- [ ] Permission Assignment
- [ ] Role Assignment to Users

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Audit Log UI
- [ ] Bulk User Management
- [ ] API Access Management

## Security Considerations
1. **Data Isolation**
   - Companies within tenants are completely isolated
   - Cross-company data access is prohibited
   - Tenant-wide data accessible only to tenant admin

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT tokens include tenant and company context
   - Role-based access control at both tenant and company level
   - All actions are logged for audit purposes

## API Structure
```
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/
  ├── companies/
  │    ├── {companyId}/
  │    │    ├── users/
  │    │    └── roles/
  │    └── ...
  ├── users/
  ├── roles/
  └── audit-logs/
```

## Future Considerations
1. **Multi-tenant Admin Support**
   - Super admin role for managing multiple tenants
   - Cross-tenant analytics and management
   - Tenant template system

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Two-factor authentication
   - IP whitelisting
   - Advanced audit logging

3. **Scalability**
   - Role caching
   - Permission optimization
   - Bulk operations support
